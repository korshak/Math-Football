Hi, everybody. It's a desktop game like football but mathematical.
Two players can play this game. Each player can make two types of step. It's a pass and throw.
The game is started in the middle of field. Then you should try to make polyline with 3 edges, excepting used vertices and not crossing others polylines. If your step is finished from new active point it is not real to make the polyline you should make throw. When throw is finished you should allow to next step another player. If any player can not make throw it's draw. You can easy make step using green dots.
Each player should tend to make line to any vertice of enemy gate.
